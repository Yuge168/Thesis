  % The Bibliograpy should go here. BEFORE appendices!
  %
  % I am not sure if alphabetical ordering is required, but it
  % certainly makes the text difficult to read, especially where
  % one has multiple references in a single \cite{} command.

% APPENDICES
%
% Any chapters appearing after the \appendix command get numbered with
% capital letters starting with appendix 'A'.
% New chapters from here on will be called 'Appendix A', 'Appendix B'
% as opposed to 'Chapter 1', 'Chapter 2', etc.
