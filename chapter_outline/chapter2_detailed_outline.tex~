  \centering{C2: An Alternative Mathematical Method for Shape Description}

  \1 Kac’s Idea: Can One Hear the Shape of a Drum? \cite{kac1966can}
  
    \2 Interpretations of Kac's Problem
      \3 When the drum vibrates, one can hear the sound, which is composed of tones of various frequencies. How much can shape features be inferred from hearing a discrete spectrum of pure tones produced by a drum?
      \3 If a complete sequence of eigenvalues of the Dirichlet problem for the Laplacian can be obtained precisely, will people determine the shape of a planar?
      
    \2 Problem Statement by Mathematical Language
      \3 Consider a simply connected membrane $\Omega$ in the Euclidean space bounded by a smooth convex curve $\partial \Omega$ (e.g. a drum without any holes)
      \3 Find function $\phi$ on the closure of $\Omega$, which vanishes at the boundary $\partial \Omega$, and a number $\lambda$ satisfying $-\Delta \phi = \lambda \phi$.
        \4 $\Delta$ is the Laplace operator. e.g. $\Delta = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{\partial ^2}{\partial x_i^2}$ in Cartesian coordinate system.
        % In a Cartesian coordinate system, the Laplacian is given by the sum of second partial derivatives of the function with respect to each independent variable.
        
        \4 If there exists a solution $\phi \neq 0$, the corresponding $\lambda$ is defined as a Dirichlet eigenvalue.
        \4 For each domain $\Omega$, there has a sequence of eigenvalues $\lambda_1, \lambda_2, \lambda_3, ... $ corresponding to a set of eigenfunction $\phi_1, \phi_2, \phi_3, ...$.
        \4 $\phi_k$ form an orthonormal basis of $L^2(\Omega)$ of real valued eigenfunctions; the corresponding discrete Dirichlet eigenvalues are positive ($\lambda_k \in \mathbb{R^{+}}$).
      \3 An important function \cite{grieser2013hearing}: $h(t) = \sum_{k=1}^{k=\infty} e^{-\lambda_kt}$
        \4 It is a Dirichlet series.
        \4 It is called the spectral function or the heat trace.
        \4 It is smooth and converges for every $t>0$.

    %\2 Understanding the Problem in the Physical Context by Diffusion Theory
      %\3 Diffusion Equation: It describes the density fluctuations of the diffusing material.
      %\3 $C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t | \bm{s_0})$
        %\4 It indicates the concentration of matter (i.e. microscopic particles) at $\bm{s}$ at time $t$ starting from $\bm{s_0}$.
        %\4 It satisfies the diffusion equation \cite{crank1979mathematics}
        %\par
        %\begin{equation}\label{eq:diffusion_eq}
          %\frac{\partial C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t| \bm{s_0})}{\partial t} = D\Delta C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t| \bm{s_0})
        %\end{equation}
        %\begin{itemize}
          %\item $D$ is the diffusion coefficient
          %\item In Kac's paper, $D$ is a constant. For simplicity, let $D$ be $1$.
        %\end{itemize}
        
        %\4 Initial condition: $C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t| \bm{s_0}) = \delta(\bm{s}-\bm{s_0})$ as $t \rightarrow 0$ (Dirac delta function): $\delta \neq 0$ if and only if $\bm{s} = \bm{s_0}$; all of the mass concentrates at the origin;
        %\4 Dirichlet Boundary condition: $C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t| \bm{s_0})=0$ for $\bm{s} \in \partial \Omega$
          %\begin{itemize}
            %\item It is also called the absorbing boundary condition.
            %\item e.g. any chemical molecule will be instantly absorbed when it touches the boundary $\partial \Omega$. 
          %\end{itemize}
          
        %\4 It can be expressed in terms of eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ and the corresponding normalized eigenvalues $\phi_k$ by: $C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t| \bm{s_0}) = \sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \phi_k(\bm{s}) \phi_k(\bm{s_0}) e^{-\lambda_kt}$.
 
      %\3 As $t \rightarrow 0^{+}$,
      %\par
      %\begin{equation}
        %\begin{split}
        %\int_{\Omega} C_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t| \bm{s_0})d\bm{s_0} &\simeq \int_{\Omega} C_{\Omega}(\bm{s_0}, t| \bm{s_0})d\bm{s_0}\\
        %&= \int_{\Omega} \Big(\sum_{k=1}^{\infty} \phi^2_k(\bm{s_0}) e^{-\lambda_kt} \Big) d\bm{s_0} \\
        %&= \sum_{k=1}^{k=\infty} e^{-\lambda_kt} \\
        %&= h(t)
        %\end{split}
      %\end{equation}
      %where $\int_{\Omega} \phi^2_k(\bm{s_0})d\bm{\bm{s_0}} = 1$ because of the normalization of $\phi$.
        
    \2 Summarize the Results of Kac's Idea
      \3 As $t \rightarrow 0^{+}$, the leading terms of the asymptotic expansion of $h(t)$ imply the geometrical attributes of $\Omega$
        \4 the total area
        \4 the perimeter
        \4 the curvature
      \3 If the domain $\Omega$ has the polygonal boundary, the third term shows in the information about the interior angles of the polygon \cite{grieser2013hearing}.

   \2 Conclusion
      \3 Advantages
        \4 Kac proposed a novel analytical mathematical method for the shape description without using measuring tools, e.g. rulers.
        \4 Other mathematicians extended Kac's idea in exploring the geometrical information of more complex domains with various boundary conditions \cite{khabou2007shape}\cite{gottlieb1985eigenvalues}\cite{gottlieb1983hearing} \cite{zayed1989heat}\cite{sleeman1984trace}.  
     \3 Limitations
        \4 It is only available for the convex domain, which has a smooth or piecewise smooth boundary.  
        \4 Except in very few cases (i.e. rectangular, disk, certain triangles), the complete sequence of eigenvalues $\lambda_k$ can not be calculated \cite{grieser2013hearing}.
        \4 Only the first few terms in the asymptotic expansion of $h(t)$ are explicitly available.

        \newpage
        
  \1 Extended Work of Kac’s Idea \cite{desjardins1994heat}\cite{vandenberg1994heat}: Heat Content
    \2 Fouier's Heat Equation \cite{baron1878analytical}
      %\3 Connection with the diffusion equation Eq.~\ref{eq:diffusion_eq} mentioned in Kac's paper
        %\4 When the diffusion coefficient of the diffusion equation is independent of the density (i.e. constant diffusion coefficient), the diffusion equation is also named the heat equation.
      \3 Mathematical Formula
        \par
        \begin{equation}\label{eq:heat_eq}
          \frac{\partial u(\bm{s}, t)}{\partial t} = \Delta u(\bm{s}, t)
        \end{equation}
        %\4 $D$ is a positive coefficient. %  called the diffusivity of the medium; Diffusivity is a rate of diffusion, a measure of the rate at which particles or heat or fluids can spread.
      \3 Interpretation
      \par
      It is a deterministic model used to characterize the evolution of quantities over the space and time. (e.g. the flow of heat)
        %\3 Physical interpretation: conservation of heat per unit volume over an infinitesimally samll volumne lying in the interior of the flow domain;

    \2 Summarize the Idea
      \3 Initial-Boundary Value Problem (IBVP)
        \par
        $u(\bm{s}, t)$ indicates the value of the tempretature at $\bm{s} \in \Omega$ at time $t$ satisfying Eq.~\ref{eq:heat_eq} and 
         \4 Initial condition: $u(\bm{s}, t) = f(\bm{s})$ as $t \rightarrow 0$.
         \4 Dirichlet boundary condition: $u(\bm{s}, t)=0$ for $\bm{s} \in \partial \Omega$
         \par
          It is also called the absorbing boundary condition; i.e. any molecule will be instantly absorbed when it touches the boundary $\partial \Omega$;


      \3 A Basic Integration
         \par
          \begin{align}
            \beta_{\Omega}(f, g)(t) &= \int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} H_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t | \bm{s_0}) f(\bm{s_0}) g(\bm{s}) d\bm{s_0} d\bm{s} \label{eq:integral_full} \\
            &= \int_{\Omega} u(\bm{s}, t) g(\bm{s}) d\bm{s} \label{eq:integral_convol}
          \end{align}
         
        \4 $H_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t | \bm{s_0})$ is called the heat kernel of $\Omega$ describing the density of the heat at $\bm{s}$ after time $t$ when initially there is only one single hot source at $\bm{s_0}$. 
        \4 $u(\bm{s}, t)$ is the general solution to Eq.~\ref{eq:heat_eq}, which can be expressed as the convolution of the initial condition with the heat kernel of the domain.
        \4 $g(\bm{s})$ is an auxiliary test function for studying the distributional nature of the tempretature function $u(\bm{s}, t)$ near $\partial \Omega$. 

     \3 Heat Content Calculation
       \par
       Given 
       \begin{equation}\label{eq:g}
         g(\bm{s}) = 1  
       \end{equation}

       \begin{align}
         Q_{\Omega}(t) &= \int_{\Omega} \int_{\Omega} H_{\Omega}(\bm{s}, t | \bm{s_0}) f(\bm{s_0})  d\bm{s_0} d\bm{s} \label{eq:heat_content_integral_full} \\
            &= \int_{\Omega} u(\bm{s}, t) d\bm{s} \label{eq:heat_content_integral_convol}
       \end{align}
       
          
        
     \3 Shape Characterization
        \4 As $t \rightarrow 0^{+}$, $Q_{\Omega}(t) \simeq \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \beta_n(\Omega) t ^{\frac{n}{2}}$
        \4 Obtain geometrical information of $\Omega$ from $\beta_n$
         \begin{itemize}
           \item area
           \item length
           \item scalar curvature
           \item mass
         \end{itemize}
         

    \2 Conclusion
      \3 Strengthness
        \4 Instead of calculating a complete sequence of the Dirichlet eigenvalues for exploring the shape attributes of geometry, the asymptotic expansion of the heat content, defined as integrating the solution to the heat equation over the space-dimension, also implies the geometrical characteristics.  
      \3 Limitations
        \4 Only the infinitly differentiable boundary $\partial \Omega$ is considered.
        \4 Only the first few terms in the asymptotic expansion are explicitly known.
        \4 Either irregular geometries or discontinuities lead to the complexities, so the explicit solutions $u(\bm{s}, t)$ are close to non-existed.
        \4 The numerical evaluation of the analytical $u(\bm{s}, t)$ and $Q_{\Omega}(t)$ is usually by no means trivial because they are in the form of infinite series.
        \4 Similiarly, only the first few coeffients $\beta_n$ in the asymptotic expansion of $Q_{\Omega}(t)$ can be expressed as the complicated explicit forms.

  \1 Numerical Methods for Solving Parabolic Partial Differential Equations
    \2 Parabolic PDEs: to characterize time-dependent phenomena
    \2 The intrinsically similar features of the traditional computational techniques are mesh discretization in time and space.
    \2 Finite Difference Method (FDM) \cite{grossmann2007numerical}
      \3 Basic Ideas: replace derivatives in the equation by the difference quotients; 
      \3 A simpliest example of FDM in solving $2-$dimensional heat equation by Forward Time Centered Space (FTCS) \cite{pletcher2012computational}
         \4 It is an explict method: utilize a simple explicit formula to evaluate the unknown function at each of the spatial mesh points at the new time level.
         \4 Prilimarty step: discretize the domain by a set of mesh points.
         \4 Secondary step: replace the derivatives by finite difference approximations based on FTCS.
           \begin{itemize}
             \item discretize the Laplace operator in space
             \item discretize the time derivative
           \end{itemize}
         \4 Third step: determine the time and step size by a condition for numerical stability.
         \4 Fourth step: fill in the initial and boundary values in the initialied matrix.
         \4 Fifth step: estimate the field values (e.g. tempreature) at the finite number of space-time points by the iterations.
         \4 Final Step: visualize the numerical results.

      \3 Stengthness
         \4 Compared with other numerical methods, it is the easy to code from the implementational point of view.
      \3 Weakness \cite{crank1979mathematics} \cite{hoffman2018numerical}
         \4 The truncation error appears in the process of ignoring the higher-order terms in the Taylor series to obtain the finite difference equations.
         \4 Round-off error results from the loss of precision due to the computer rounding of decimal quantities.
         \4 Discretization error can be reduced by decreasing the time size, grid size, or both of them, but the computational time will be longer.
         \4 It will be inaccurate and arduous in the practical application when the problem is defined in the irregular geometries.
      
    \2 Finite Element Method (FEM) \cite{zlamal1968finite}
      \3 Foundamental Concepts 
         \4 Finite element: divide the complicated geometries, irregular shapes, and boundaries into an union of smaller and simpler subdomains (e.g. lattice, triangle, curvilinear polygons, etc.) \cite{logan2011first}; adjacent element are connected by the nodes.
         \4 Element equation: reprsent each subdomain by the piecewise continuous polynomial basis function.
         \4 Model the whole system: assemble all the element equations into a system of algebraic equations.
         \4 Slove algebraic equations by minimizing the associated error function.
      \3 Stengthness
         \4 FEM can be used to solve a wide range of PDEs defined in a complex geometry.
         \4 Spatial discretization is flexible since the mesh can adapt to irregularly shaped boundaries to reduce geometric errors.
         \4 A specific region can be refined locally to give more resolution.
         \4 For a considerable number of elements, the paralleling computation can be used to improve the computational efficiency.
      \3 Weakness
         \4 Users may make mistakes in building the FE model, checking the result, detecting and updating the model design.
         \4 The round-off errors will affect the precision of the nuemrical results.
         \4 FEM demands a longer execution time and an enormous amount of input data compared with FDM.
      
    \2 Other Tranditional Computational Methods
      \3 Finite Volume Method (FVM) \cite{eymard2000finite}
      \3 Boundary Element Method (BEM) \cite{attaway1991boundary}
      
    \2 Limitation in Practice  
      \3 The size of the mesh, subdomain, or volumn will determine the precision of the approximated solution, the smaller being the better. However, the finer discretization will increase the demand for computational resources such as memory and processor time.
      \3 In this thesis, the problem domain $\Omega$ is bounded by the border of the image and the edge of the whole extremly complicated root system with millions of pixels and various boundary conditions. The complexity of coding is the main practical limitation.
      \3 The purpose of this thesis is to approxiate $Q_{\Omega}(t)$, defined as an integration over the space dimension, which results in the extra effort and errors.
