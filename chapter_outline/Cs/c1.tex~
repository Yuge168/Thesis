  \1 Summary of Existed Descriptors
    \2 Metric
      \3 Basic Geometric Descriptors
        \4 maximum depth
        \4 maximum width
        \4 etc.
      \3 Compound Descriptors (Computed From the Basic Descriptors)
        \4 Density
        \4 aspect ratio
        \4 etc.
      \3 Weaknesses
        \4 Rely on the resolution of the images \cite{balduzzi2017reshaping}
        \4 Only provide a general view of root morphology \cite{balduzzi2017reshaping}
        \4 Difficult to assess the spatial configuration of roots
        \4 Fail to describe the full complexity of root systems

    \2 Non-metric
      \3 Topological Analysis
        \4 Persistent homology \cite{li2017persistent}
          \begin{itemize}
            \item Persistence barcode shows the number of branches.
            \item Persistence barcode indicates how branched roots connect along the scale of the function (e.g. geodesic distance).
            \item Compare the similarity of branching structures by a pair-wise distance matrix using the bottleneck distance method.
          \end{itemize}
          
       \4 Horton-Strahler index \cite{toroczkai2001topological}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Categorize the topological complexity of the whole branching structure.
            \item Provide a numerical measure of connectedness and complexity of the branching at each vertex by a dimensionless ratio: bifurcation ratio.
            \item The range of index and the length ratio indicate the size of the branching structure.
         \end{itemize}
                
       \4 Fractal Analysis \cite{tatsumi1989fractal}
         \begin{itemize}
            \item Measure the complexity of branching structures.
            \item Measure self-similarity of branching structures by fractal dimension of the root systems.
         \end{itemize}

     \3 Strengths
       \4 Highly complementary to geometric descriptors to characterize how individual roots are connected through branching \cite{delory2018archidart}.
       \4 Describe branching structures independent of transformation and deformation.

     \3 Problems and Weaknesses
       \4 Only analyze the connectedness of branching structures, which is a portion of the complexity of plant root systems.
       \4 Fail to characterize spatial distribution.
       \4 Some biologically topological indices analyze the root growth qualitatively based on line-linked systems \cite{fitter1986topology}, but not characterize the mathematical topological properties.
       \4 The fractal analysis aims to describe self-similar structures, which grow by continually repeating simple growth rules \cite{fitter1992fractal}.

  \1 Problem Statements
    \2 Limitation of Data: large variance of length scales of root leads to the high requirement of the image resolution.
    \2 Incompleteness and Low Efficiency
      \3 The finite number of descriptors can not recover overall root system architecture.
      \3 Diverse units of the measurement results in extra efforts in multivariate data analysis.
      \3 Roots are not self-similar inherently.
