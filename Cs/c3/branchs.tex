\section{Complicated Branching Structures}



In the preceding section, the research hypothesis has been tested by
the comparison of simple shapes. More complex branching structures, as
shown in Fig.~\ref{fig:G1_imgs} and Fig.~\ref{fig:G2_imgs}, are
produced in this section for further validation of the research
assumption and understanding of the survival curve. The branching
structures in the images are equal-area and vertically symmetric, but
the template in $G_1$ is shorter and narrower than in $G_2$. In $G_i$,
$i=1, 2$, the larger number of iterations $j$, the more complicated
structures $L_j$, $j=3, 4, 5, 6$, with more nodes.
