Survival analysis is a series of statistical methods dealing with
variables that have both a time and event associated with them. It can
be applied in a variety of fields \cite{clark2003survival}, including
cancer studies in clinical research, event-history analysis in
sociology, failure-time analysis in engineering, and so on. As
introduced in the last section ~\ref{section:MC_heat_content}, the
event we are interested in is whether the particle hit the absorbing
boundary or not, and the time refers to the number of steps, $n$,
taken by the particle in LRWs. However, in this section, two novel
forms of functions stem from the underlying survival process are
developed for characterizing the shape of the object in the image.


\subsection{Survival Analysis of Displacement $S(d)$}

In some survival analysis applications, the origin-destination
distance can be an alternative random variable to the time. For
example, in the study of transport habits
\cite{anastasopoulos2017transport} \cite{su12166331}, trip
distance-based survival analysis can reveal traveller preference and
trip patterns and measure the effects of explanatory variables. In
Monte Carlo simulations, the displacement of a particle, $d$, is the
shortest distance from the initial to the stop position in the
infinite tiling space, which is affected by the number of steps
$n$. Suppose $\mathcal{D}$ is a non-negative random variable
representing the displacement moved by the particle from the origin to
any sites of absorbing boundary. Like the $S(n)$, for any $d>0$, we
can define $S(d)$ as

\begin{equation}\label{eq:sf_disp}
  S(d) = Pr(\mathcal{D} > d) = 1 - F(d)
\end{equation}
where $S(d)$ indicates the probability that the particle has not yet
been absorbed when the displacement beyond $d$, and $F$ is the
cumulative distribution function. Moreover, both $S(d)$ and $F(d)$ are
right continuous in this thesis.

As mentioned before, the KM \cite{kaplan1958nonparametric}, or
product-limit, can be used to estimate the survival function
nonparametrically. Suppose that $N$ particles determined by
Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality
\cite{dvoretzky1956asymptotic} undergo LRWs independently in the
simulation with distinct increasing non-negative displacements $d_1<
d_2< ...<d_j <...<d_k$. The probability of particles being alive at
displacement $d_j$, $S(d_j)$, is calculated from $S(d_{j-1})$ by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:km_disp}
  S(d_j) = S(d_{j-1}) \Big( 1-\frac{\tilde{n}_j}{n_j} \Big)
\end{equation}
where $n_j$ is the number of particles have not hit the target
boundary within the displacement $d_j$, and $\tilde{n}_j$ is the number of
particles being absorbed at displacement $d_j$. 




\subsection{Empty Space Function $F(r)$}

Another function generated in the Monte Carlo simulation is associated
with the discs centred at the initial positions of particles. The
radius, $R$, of a disc is the shortest distance from a random initial
site, $s \in \mathbb{R}^2$, to the fixed absorbing boundary, $\Gamma
\subseteq \mathbb{R}^2$, in the whole tiling of the plane.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dist_point_set}
  R = \rho(s, \Gamma) = \inf \left\{ \lVert s-a \lVert : a \in \Gamma \right\}
\end{equation}

The empty space function \cite{baddeley2007spatial} of a point process
\cite{zahle1982random} gives us an insight into the distribution of
the random variable $R$. A point process is a collection of points
located randomly in some underlying mathematical spaces. It evolved
gradually from renewal theory and the statistical analysis of life
tables dating back to the $17$th century
\cite{daley2007introduction}. Point process data has been applied in
various fields, such as epidemiology, ecology, forestry, mining,
hydrology, astronomy, ecology, and meteorology. $1-$dimensional point
process can be used to model a sequence of random times when a
specific event happens. For example, given any period of time, a
restaurant can receive calls at random instants or points of
time. Suppose we map the caller locations on a particular day. Then,
the map will constitute a random pattern of points in two dimensions
because there will have an arbitrary number of such points, and their
positions are random. Therefore, a spatial point process can model the
random pattern of points in $2-$dimensional space. If both the time
and locations are recorded, we can consider it as a space-time point
process in three dimensions. It is also a simple instance of the
marked point process \cite{baddeley2007spatial} since each location in
$\mathbb{R}^2$ is labelled or marked by the time of the call in
$\mathbb{R}$.

Let $\bm{X}$ be a stationary point process in $\mathbb{R}^k$, the
empty space function \cite{baddeley2007spatial}, $F(r)$, also named
spherical contact distribution function, is the cumulative
distribution function of the distance from a fixed point $u$ to the
nearest point of random set $\bm{X}$,

%\begin{equation}\label{eq:dist_point_process}
 % F(r) = Pr(\rho(u, \bm{X}) \leq r) = Pr(\rho(0, \bm{X}) \leq r)
%\end{equation}
%where $r \geq 0$ and $F(r)$ is independent on $u$ because of the
%stationarity.
