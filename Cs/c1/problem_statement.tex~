\1 Problem Statements
    \2 Limitation of Data: large variance of length scales of root leads to the high requirement of the image resolution.
    \2 Incompleteness and Low Efficiency
      \3 The finite number of descriptors can not recover overall root system architecture.
      \3 Diverse units of the measurement results in extra efforts in multivariate data analysis.
      \3 Roots are not self-similar inherently.
