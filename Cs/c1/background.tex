   \subsection{Importance of Roots}
      \begin{itemize}
        \item Mechanical and functional abilities of plant roots
        \item Plant root plasticity in the resource-limited environment
      \end{itemize}
      
     \subsection{Importance of Research}
       \subsubsection{Demand in crop breeding programs}
       \subsubsection{Environment and Sustainability}

         \begin{itemize}
           \item reduce the negative impacts of fertilization
           \item high crop productivity to feed the increasing global population
         \end{itemize}
         
       \subsection{Promising application in other branching structures}
         \begin{itemize}
           \item Trees
           \item River networks in geography
           \item Blood vessels in medicine
           \item Leaf vein networks
         \end{itemize}
