The thesis is written in thesis_uofs.tex based on the template of U of S. I have highlighted the title of a subsubsection, which is a confusing part for me. Based on the template's introduction, the table of content will be generated automatically if the sectioning commands are appropriately used. However, it does not work. I guess I did something wrong when I insert the sections or subsections.  


# Run the following commands:
(1) BibTex thesis_uofs <br /> (2) pdflatex thesis_uofs
