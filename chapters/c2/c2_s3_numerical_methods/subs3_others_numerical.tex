Another method closely related to the FEM is the finite volume method
(FVM). It converts the original heat equation into the integral forms
\cite{eymard2000finite}. However, the accuracy of FVM is related to
the integration over time and space. Unlike the domain-type methods
(e.g. FDM, FEM, FVM, etc.), the boundary element method (BEM)
transforms the heat equation into an integral equation over the
boundary of the domain using the boundary integral equation method
\cite{attaway1991boundary}. When the region extends to infinity or its
edge is complex, BEM is more efficient in computation than other
methods because of the smaller surface or volume ratio
\cite{katsikadelis2002boundary} since it only discretizes the boundary
and fits the boundary values into the integral equation
\cite{ang2007beginner}. However, the matrics generated in the BEM are
generally unsymmetric and fully populated, which are difficult to be
solved \cite{mushtaq2010advantages}.
