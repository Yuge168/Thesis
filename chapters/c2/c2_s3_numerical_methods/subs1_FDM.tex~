FDM is frequently utilized to converting the heat equation into a
system of algebraically solvable
equations \cite{grossmann2007numerical}. The basic idea is to replace
the derivatives in the equation by the difference quotients. For
example, the FTCS (Forward Time Centered Space)
scheme \cite{pletcher2012computational} discretize the Laplace
operator in space and the time derivative and implement the boundary
conditions on the staggered grid for representing the original
continuous problem, but it is conditionally
stable \cite{pletcher2012computational}. If the spatial resolution
becomes doubled, the time-step should be reduced by a factor of four
to maintain the numerical stability, which causes the extremely tiny
time-step in the high-resolution calculations. There are three kinds
of errors needed to be considered when using FDM. First of all, in the
derivation of the finite-difference equations, the higher-order terms
in the Taylor series are neglected, constituting the truncation
error. If the time and space interval tends to $0$, the truncation
errors will approach $0$, or the FDM is incompatible or inconsistent
with the original heat equation \cite{crank1979mathematics}. Another
class of error appearing in FDM, called round-off error, results from
the loss of precision due to the computer rounding of decimal
quantities. \cite{hoffman2018numerical}. The last type of error is the
discretization error, which can be reduced by decreasing the time
size, grid size, or both \cite{crank1979mathematics}. Moreover, DFM
becomes less accurate and hard to implement when the problem is
defined in the irregular geometries since the heat equation must be
transformed before applying the Taylor series.
