\section{Heat Content in Annulus}

Since the heat equation defined in an annulus possesses explicit solutions, the analytical expressions of heat content are accessible, which can also be approximated by numerical analysis. The numerical approximation of heat content in an annulus can be used for validating the research methodology.  

\subsection{Analytical Results}

The heat equation describes the flow of heat in the $\Omega$ as shown in Figure $1.1$, and its solution implies the temperature over spatial positions and time. The main purpose of this subsection is to calcuate the total amount of heat contained in the domain $\Omega$, heated at some nonzero temperature, whose $\partial \Omega_{1}$ is cooled to the zero temperature, and $\partial \Omega_{2}$ is perfectly insulated. Diffusion theory is a probabilistic interpretation of this problem, defined in the polar coordinate system as 

\begin{equation}
  u_t = D \big(u_{rr} + \frac{1}{r} u_r + \frac{1}{r^2} u_{\theta\theta}\big)  
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  u = 0 \; \; \; on \; \partial \Omega_1
\end{equation}

\begin{equation}
  u' = 0 \; \; \; on \; \partial \Omega_2
\end{equation}

\clearpage

\begin{equation}
  u(r, \theta, 0) = 0 
\end{equation}


where $D$ is the diffusion coeffiecnt, $r$ is radial coordinate, $\theta$ is the angular coordinate, and $t$ is the time. $u(r, \theta, t)$ is a probability density function, which gives the value of random walking particles at $(r, \theta)$ at time $t$. Eq.$(1.2)$ and Eq.$(1.3)$ indicate the Dirichlet boundary condition on $\partial \Omega_1$ and the Neumann boundary condition on $\partial \Omega_2$, respectively. In other words, the wandering particles will be absorbed when they encounter with $\partial \Omega_1$ and be reflecting when they reach $\partial \Omega_2$. Eq.$(1.4)$ states that the particles distribute uniformly over the whole domain at time $t=0$, where $|\Omega|$ equals the total area of the annulus.

\subsubsection{Solving Diffusion Equation}

Before solving the diffusion equation defined in an annulus, it is convenient and efficient to generate some dimensionless variables by dimensional analysis. The benefit of dimensional analysis is that many physical parameters can be combined into a smaller number of dimensionless variables, which do not depend on the unit of the measurements and can also describe the phenomenon of interest \cite{barenblatt1996scaling}.



\newpage

Define $\mu = b/a$ as the dimensionless radius ratio, $\tau = \frac{Dt}{a^2}$ as the dimensionless time, and $\hat r = \frac{r}{a}$ as the unitless radius. Substitute the dimensionless variables and rewrite Eq.$(1.1)$ as

\begin{equation}
  u_\tau = \big(u_{\hat r \hat r} + \frac{1}{\hat r} u_{\hat r} + \frac{1}{\hat r ^2} u_{\theta\theta}\big)
\end{equation}

With the uniform initial condition,
$$u\big(\hat r, \theta, 0\big) = \frac{1}{|\Omega|}$$

With the boundary conditions
$$u\big(1, \theta, \tau\big) = 0$$
$$u'\big(\mu, \theta, \tau \big) = 0$$

After implementing the separation of variables method, the solutions of Eq.$(1.4)$ are

\begin{equation}
  u\big(\hat r, \theta, \tau \big) = \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \tilde{c_{0,n}} \bigg\{J_0\big(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}}\big) Y_0\big(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}} \hat r\big) - Y_0\big(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}}\big) J_0\big(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}} \hat r\big)\bigg\} e^{-\lambda_{0,n}\tau}
\end{equation}

where

$$\tilde{c_{0,n}} = \frac{1}{\big(\mu^2 - 1\big)} \frac{1}{\bigg[\frac{J_0\big(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}}\big)}{J'_0\big(\mu \sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}}\big)}\bigg]^2 -1}$$


Eigenvalues $\lambda_{0, n}$ $(n \in \mathbb{N}_{+})$ is $n$th positive root of the cross-product of Bessel functions,

\begin{equation}
  F_0(\lambda) = J_0(\sqrt{\lambda}) Y_0'(\sqrt{\lambda} \mu) - J_0'(\sqrt{\lambda} \mu) Y_0(\sqrt{\lambda})
\end{equation}

\subsubsection{Heat Content (Survival Probability)}

The amount of heat contained in the $\Omega$ at the moment $\tau > 0$ called heat content $Q_{\Omega}(\tau)$, which is an alternative terminology of survival probability in some mathematical literatures \cite{birkhoff1954note} \cite{van1994heat} \cite{gilkey1994heat}. Survival probability $S(\tau)$ is proportional to $Q_{\Omega}(\tau)$ \cite{kalinay2011survival}, which gives the probability of the particles remain diffusing in the domain $\Omega$ at time $\tau > 0$ \cite{aalen2008survival}. Survival probability can be expressed by

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    S(\tau) &= \int_{0}^{2\pi} d\theta \int_{1}^{\mu} \hat r d \hat r u(\hat r, \theta, \tau)\\
            &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{\mu^2 - 1} \frac{1}{\lambda_{0,n} \bigg\{\bigg[\frac{J_0(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}})}{J'_0(\mu \sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}})}\bigg]^2 -1\bigg\}} e^{-\lambda_{0, n} \tau}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

From Eq.$(1.8)$, we can find some basic properties of $S(\tau)$. Firstly, when $\tau=0$, the survival probability is $1$ since all the particles are just generated over the whole domain and not be absorbed by $\Omega_1$. Secondly, $S(\tau)$ is a convergent series with multiexponential decay. Thirdly, $S(\tau)$ interconnects the overall geometric characteristics of $\Omega$. For example, the decay rate of $S(\tau)$ in a short time heavily depends on the geometrical features of $\Omega_1$, as only the particles inserted close to $\Omega_1$ have the high probabilities of being absorbed. Finally, as the lone-time limit, $S(\tau)$ is represented by the lowest eigenvalue $\lambda_{0, 1}$.

\subsubsection{Mean First-Passage Time}

In a stochastic process, the first time is taken by a random walker to go from the starting site to reach the target position called particle's first-passage time. The mean-first passage time $\langle \tau \rangle$, also called the average first passage time, of a group of particles implies an overall property of the system. 

\begin{equation}
  \begin{split}
    \langle \tau \rangle &= \int_{0}^{\infty} \tau dS\\
      &= \sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac{4}{\mu^2 - 1} \frac{1}{\lambda^2_{0,n} \bigg\{\bigg[\frac{J_0(\sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}})}{J'_0(\mu \sqrt{\lambda_{0,n}})}\bigg]^2 -1\bigg\}}
  \end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Numerical Analysis}

Numerical analysis is an area of mathematics and computer science that creates, analyzes, and implements algorithms for approximating numerical solutions to problems involving continuous variables. For simplicity, a specific kind of annulus is considered, which has the radius ratio $\mu=2$. 

The preliminary step of the evaluation of $S(\tau)$ and $\langle \tau \rangle$ is to compute the monotonically increasing $\lambda_{0,n}$ of Eq.$(1.7)$. The $n$th positive zero $\lambda_{0,n}$, as $n \rightarrow \infty $, can be bracketed in an interval $((n-1) \pi, (n+1) \pi)$ \cite{NIST:DLMF}. Bisection method \cite{2020SciPy-NMeth}, a well-known and most reliable root finding method, can be used to close in on it by successivly halving the interval until it becomes sufficiently small.

(b) The asymptotic behaviors of survival probability $S(\tau)$ are approximated by the numerical method with the first $1000$ eigenvalues. $S(\tau)$ monotonously descrese from 1 at $\tau=0$ to $0$ as $\tau$ goes to infinity. Moreover, the approximation of analytical mean first-passage time is $\langle \tau \rangle = 0.47339248$.}
