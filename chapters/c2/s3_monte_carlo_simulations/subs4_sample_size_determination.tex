\subsection{Sample Size Determination}

Based on the law of large number (LLN) \cite{dekking2005modern}, as
the sample size approaches infinity, the sample mean tends to get
closer to the true population mean with the high
probability. Moreover, the central limit theorem (CLT)
\cite{dekking2005modern} illustrates how the sampling distribution of
the mean changes as a function of the sample size and how much more
reliable a large experiment is. On the downside, the increasing number
of trials results in the higher cost of performing the simulation,
which is the major drawback of the fixed time-step Monte Carlo
simulations. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct the minimum number
of simulation runs to achieve a desired degree of precision.
