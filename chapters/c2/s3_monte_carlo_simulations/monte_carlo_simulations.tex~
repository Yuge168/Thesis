\section{Monte Carlo Simualtions}


\subsection{Background}

Either irregular geometries or discontinnuities cause the complication
in solving the partial differential eqautions (PDEs) in practice, so
the nice algebraic solutions are close to non-existed. Therefore, the
computer simulations and numerical methods are more useful and popular
in solving differential equations than calculating the pure analytical
solutions.

\subsection{Numerical Methods}

The techniques for solving the initial-boundary value problems (IBVPs)
based on numerical approximations have existed for a long time. The
finite-difference methods (FDM) are widely used and easily implemented
in solving the differential equations by converting them into a system
of algebraically solvable equations \cite{grossmann2007numerical}. The
basic idea is to replace the derivatives in the equations by
difference quotients. For example, the FTCS (Forward Time Centered
Space) scheme \cite{pletcher2012computational} is propoesd to
approximate the numerical solutions of the heat equation and similar
parabolic partial differential equations. It decretizes the Laplace
operator in space and the time derivative, and implementing boundary
conditions on the staggered grid to represent the original continuous
problem, but it is numerically stable if and only if it satsifies a
specified condition \cite{pletcher2012computational}. Generally, there
are two classes of errors appearing in FDM called round-off error and
truncation error. The former one results from the loss of precision
due to computer rounding of decimal quantities. The latter one is
caused by discarding the remainders in the difference apprximation and
highly depends on the time and space step. In other words, the smaller
step size, the longer simulation duration and higher data quality
\cite{hoffman2018numerical}.


Compared with FDM, the finite element method (FEM) is particularly
solving partial differential equations in two or three space
dimensions with relativly higher quality by dividing the complicated
geometries and boundarirs of the physical system into a amount of
smaller and simpler subdomains \cite{logan2011first} (eg. lattice,
trangle, curvilinear polygons, etc.). Every subdomain is locally
approximated by a finite set of element equations (piecewise shape
functions), which are finally assembled into a larger system of
equations for modeling the entire problem. The goal of FEM is
approximate a stable solution by minimizing the associated error
function with the varational calculus. The major advantages of FEM are
representing the complex geometries accuratly, exploring the local
character of the approximation, and expressing the solutions in a
unified formulation \cite{reddy1993introduction}. However, FED method
needs an amount of mathematical skill that requires human involvement,
for example, converting the original equation into the equivalent
weak formulation, choosing and changing the variational formulation
dicretization strategy in a particular problem, and so on. In this
thesis, applying the absorbing boundary conditions on the border of
the roots. However, the complexity of real root systems in 2D images
make it time-comsuming and challenging to trace and define the problem
geometry, label the nodes, and generate the coordinates and
connectivities among the nodes in the stage of preprocessing FEM. 


In constrast, the finite volumn method (FVM) converts the two
dimentional diffusion eqautions into a system of linear equations,
which can be solved by the direct method
\cite{eymard2000finite}. However, the accuracy of numerical methods
will be debased on the integration with respect to both time and
space. Unlike the domain-type methods (eg. FDM, FEM, FVM, etc.), the
boundary element method (BEM) is an alternative numerical computential
technique for sloving PDEs formulated as integral equation based on
the boundary. It only discretize the boudary and fits the boundary
values into the integral eqaution \cite{ang2007beginner}. Therefore,
when the domain extends to infinity or the shape of the boudnary is
complex, BEM is more efficient in computation than other methods
because of the smaller surface or volumn ratio
\cite{katsikadelis2002boundary}. However, all of these methods have an
intrinsically commom characteristic that is mesh discretization of a
continuous domain into a set of discrete sub-domains. If the mesh
becomes finer and the internal points number becomes bigger, the
solution of the discrete problem will converge to the original
boundary value problems with the higher level of accuacy, but the
computational time will be longer. Furthermore, one of the common
difficulties in applying the numerical method for solving the PDEs is
that takes much longer time to decide if the answer is right than
finding the solution. Therefore, before the simulation, it is
necessary to understand the system qualitatively for checking the
behaviours of the approximated solutions.


\subsection{Monte Carlo Techniques for PDEs}

Monte Carlo (MC) methods, commonly used computational techniques, aims
to genertate samples from a given proabability distribution, estimate
the expectations of the functions under this distribution, and
opyomaize the complicated objective functions by using random numbers
\cite{kroese2014monte}. Compare with the deterministic numerical
methods, applying Monte Carlo methdos for sloving PDEs is grid-free on
the domain, boundary, and the boundary conditions of the problem.

One of the approaches, from the deterministic prospective, for
sloving PDEs by Monte Carlo procedure is based on the classical
probabilistic representations (eg. Feynman-Kac representations
\cite{kac1987enigmas}) in the form of Wiener or diffusion path
integral \cite{sabelfeld2013random}. For example, when solve the
d-dimensional heat eqaution, the Brownian motion generated by the
second-order differential operator are simulated using the numerical
methods for sloving the stochastic differential equation
\cite{wiki:MCMheat}. However, the discretization step should be small
enough to achieve a desired accuracy, which will result in the long
simulation.

Another straghtforward approach for solving PDEs by Monte Carlo method
is based on the probabilistic interpretation of integral eqautions
equivalent to the original continous problem, whose solutions can be
represented as expectation of some functional of the trajectories of a
stochastic process
\cite{varadhan1980lectures}\cite{grebenkov2014efficient}\cite{sabelfeld2013random}.
Those trajectories can be generated by Monte Carlo techniques for
approximating the expectations and the solutions. For instance, the
estimatation of the expectation of the funcational from a Markov
process was proposed by simulating the successive positions of the
trajactory of the process at fixed instants with step $\triangle t$
\cite{kronberg1976solution}\cite{king1951monte}.


\subsection{Models for Continious Diffuison Process}


\subsubsection{Borwnian Motion and Random Walks}

Brownian motion \cite{brown1828microscopical}, the irregular motion of
individual pollen particles, have been existed before the exitence of
random walk theroy. At the begining of the twentieth century, the
term, random walk, was original proposed by Karl Pearson
\cite{pearson1905problem}. He set a simple example for modeling the
random migration of mosquitos invading cleared jungle regions. At each
time step, the mosquito move to a random direction with a fixed step
length. Rayleigh \cite{rayleigh1905problem} answered Pearson's question
about what the distrbitons of mosquitos look like after many steps
have been taken. Rayleigh 


At almost the same time, Louis Bachelier
\cite{bachelier1900theorie} developed a model of the financial time
series based on the random walk and explored the connection between
discrete random walks and the continous diffusion (heat)
equation. During the course of research on random walks, many
important fields, such as random processes, random noise, spectral
analysis and stochastic equations, were developed by some physicists
\cite{einstein1905electrodynamics} \cite{einstein1906theory}
\cite{smoluchowski1916drei}.

The heat equation describes the tempeature distribution of a certain
homogeneous and isotropic domain in which does not exist any heat
sources \cite{varadhan1980lectures}. The heat spreads randomly in all
directions at some rate in the domain, so it is more useful to
understand diffusion type PDEs by considering the individual random
particle \cite{lawler2010random}. The heat flow is a diffusion process
defined in continuous time with a continuous state space and
continuous sample paths \cite{ito2012diffusion}. Brownian motion
\cite{brown1828microscopical}, also called the Wiener process, is a
case of diffusion process with the Markov properties that is the
future states depend only on the present states
\cite{bharucha2012elements}. From a probabilistic perspective, the
probability density of Brownian particles satisfies the heat equation
or diffusion equation \cite{varadhan1980lectures}. The continuous
Brownian motion can be considered as the limit of discrete random walk
as the time and space increments go to zero \cite{lawler2010random}.


\subsubsection{Theory of Lattice Random Walks (LRWs)}

Let us consider the heat particles perform the simple random walk on
the d-dimensional integer grid \mathbb{Z^d}. It is a discrete space
and discrete time symmetric hopping process \cite{redner2001guide}. At
each time setp, a random walker moves to one of its $2d$ nearest
neighbors with probability $\frac{1}{2d}$. If $d <= 2$, the random
walk is recurrent, which means it returns to the origin infinitely
often with probaility $1$. If $d >= 3$, the random walk is transient,
which implies it returns to the origin only finitly often with
probability $1$ \cite{hughes1998random}.


For simplicity, we only consider 2-dimensional lattice random walks
(LRWs) \cite{lawler2010random}. Let $\triangle l$ be the distance
between two sites (pixel size) and $\tau$ be the time step. Define
$p(x, t| x_{S})$ as the conditional probability of a particle to be in
position $x$ at time $t$ starting from $x_{S}$ at time $t=0$. The
temperature at a site is given by the amonunt of heat going in from
nerighboring siteThus, $p(x, t + \tau |x_{S})$ is defined as
probability of a particle to be in position $x$ at time $t + \tau$
starting from $x_{S}$ at time $t=0$, where

\begin{equation}
  p(x, t + \tau | x_{S}) = \frac{p(x - \triangle l e_{x}, t| x_{S}) +
    p(x + \triangle l e_{x}, t| x_{S}) + p(x - \triangle l e_{y}, t|
    x_{S}) + p(x + \triangle l e_{y}, t| x_{S})}{4}
\end{equation}

Also, when $\tau \rightarrow 0$, $\triangle l \rightarrow 0$, and
$\tau \sim (\triangle l)^2$,

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial p(x, t| x_{S})}{\partial t} = \frac{(\triangle
    l)^2}{4 \tau} (\frac{\partial ^2 p(x, t| x_{S})}{\partial x^2} +
  \frac{\partial^2 p (x, t| x_{S})}{\partial y^2})
\end{equation}

where $\frac{(\triangle l)^2}{4 \tau} = 1$, and $\kappa =
\frac{(\triangle l)^2}{\tau}$ is the diffusion coefficent.


The $d$-dimensional heat equation in the discrete set-up is 

\begin{equation}
  \frac{\partial p(x, t| x_{S})}{\partial t} = \frac{D}{2d}
  \sum_{i=1}^{d} \frac{\partial ^2 p(x, t| x_{S})}{\partial x_{i}^2}
\end{equation}
