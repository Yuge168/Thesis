\section{Monte Carlo Simulations}

In this section, several widely used numerical methods for solving
partial differential equations (PDEs), such as the diffusion equation,
and their limitations in practice are introduced. From the
deterministic perspective, one of the probabilistic algorithms,
Monte-Carlo (CM) methods, is proposed. However, discretization errors
also affect the accuracy of the solutions. Finally, based on the
theories of two random walk models, Pearson's random walks (PRWs) and
lattice random walks (LRWs), two fixed-time step Monte Carlo
simulations are designed. Those simulations can approximate the
integration of the heat equations' solutions, named survival
functions, which describes the geometrical properties of the shape.


\subsection{Background}

In the last section in this chapter, the exact analytical solutions of
the heat equation defined in the annulus with the initial and boundary
conditions have been derived. And then, the analytical survival
probability can be calculated by the integration over the annulus for
shape characterization. This analytical method looks useful, but its
applications to practical problems will present difficulties. Firstly,
the numerical evaluation of the analytical solutions is usually by no
means trivial because they are in the form of infinite
series. Secondly, either irregular geometries or discontinuities cause
the complication in solving the heat (diffusion) equations by
analytical methods in practice, so the explicit algebraic solutions
are close to non-existed. In other words, the analytical techniques
and solutions have a severe limitation that they can apply strictly
only to the linear form of the diffusion equations and the boundary
conditions \cite{crank1979mathematics}. Therefore, numerical methods
and computer simulations are more useful and accessible in solving
differential equations than calculating pure analytical solutions.
