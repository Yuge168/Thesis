\subsubsection{Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz (DKW) inequality}

Although the sample size estimated by the general method does not
depend on the geometries characterized by the random walk models, how
long the simulation will run is unknown, and the final calculated
sample size will be larger than the really necessary value
sometimes. Therefore, an alternative method, named the
Dvoretzky–Kiefer–Wolfowitz (DKW)
inequality \cite{dvoretzky1956asymptotic}, is proposed for the sample
size determination by generating the simultaneous confidence interval
of the survival function without simulating random walk models and
considering the shape of objects in the images.

Let $F_N(x)$ denote the empirical distribution functions (empirical
CDF) for a sample of $N$ real-valued $i.i.d.$ random variables,
$X_{1}, ... , X_{N}$, with continuous cumulative distrbution function
(CDF) $F(x)$. The DKW inequality, as expressed in
Eq.~\ref{eq:dkw_ineq}, bounds the probability that the random function
$F_{N}(x)$ differs from the true $F(x)$ by more than a given constant
$\varepsilon$
\cite{dvoretzky1956asymptotic}.

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dkw_ineq}
  Pr(\sup_{x \in \mathbb{R}} |F_{N}(x) - F(x)| > \varepsilon) \leq
  2e^{-2N\varepsilon^2} \;\; \;\; for \; every \; \varepsilon > 0
\end{equation}

The equally spaced confidence bounds or simultaneous band around the
$F_{N}$ encompassing the entire $F(x)$ can be expressed by
\begin{equation}\label{eq:dkw_ineq_F}
  F_{N}(x) - \varepsilon \leq F(x) \leq F_N(x) + \varepsilon \; \; \; \; 
\end{equation}

On the other hand, assume the simultaneous band produced by
Eq.~\ref{eq:dkw_ineq_F} containing the $F(x)$ at a given confidence
level $1-\alpha$, the interval $\varepsilon$ can be calculated by

\begin{equation}\label{eq:dkw_ineq_sample_size}
  \varepsilon = \sqrt{\frac{\ln{\frac{2}{\alpha}}}{2N}}
\end{equation}


Given a converge probability $\alpha$ and constant $\varepsilon$, it
is straightforward to estimate the sample size $N$ in the fixed-time
step Monte Carlo simulations in any images by
Eq.~\ref{eq:dkw_ineq_sample_size}.
