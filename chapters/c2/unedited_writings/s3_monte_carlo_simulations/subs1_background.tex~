\section{Monte Carlo Simulations}

In this section, several widely used numerical methods for solving the
heat equation, and their limitations in practice are
introduced. From the deterministic perspective, one of the
probabilistic algorithms, Monte-Carlo (CM) methods, is
proposed. However, discretization errors also affect the accuracy of
the solutions. Finally, based on the theories of two random walk
models, Pearson's random walks (PRWs) and lattice random walks (LRWs),
two fixed-time step Monte Carlo simulations are designed. Those
simulations can approximate the integration of the heat equations'
solutions, named survival functions, which describes the geometrical
properties of the shape.



\subsection{Background}\label{background}

In the subsection~\ref{analytical results}, the exact analytical
solutions of the heat equation defined in the annulus with the initial
and boundary conditions have been derived. And then, the analytical
heat content can be calculated by the integration over the annulus for
the shape characterization.

The analytical method for solving the heat equation has many
restrictions and its applications to practical problems will present
difficulties. Firstly, the numerical evaluation of the analytical
solutions is usually by no means trivial because they are in the form
of infinite series. Secondly, either irregular geometries or
discontinuities cause the complexities in practice, so the explicit
algebraic solutions are close to non-existed. Thirdly, the purely analytical
techniques can apply strictly only to the linear form of the boundary
conditions and to constant diffusion properties
\cite{crank1979mathematics}. Therefore, the numerical methods and
computer simulations are more useful and accessible in solving the
heat equation than calculating pure analytical solutions.
