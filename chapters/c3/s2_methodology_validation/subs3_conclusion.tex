\subsection{Conclusion}


Instead of calculating the asymptotic expansion of the heat content
manually as $\tau \rightarrow 0^+$, the total heat energy $\beta$
\cite{gilkey1994heat} for time $\tau > 0$ can be approximated by the
fixed-time step Monte Carlo simulations for describing the full-scale
geometrical features of the annulus. Moreover, the required
number of particles in the simulations determined by the DKW
inequality is much smaller than the superabundant value estimated by
Chebyshevâ€™s inequality.
