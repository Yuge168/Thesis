\section{Background}

After introducing the pros and cons of the existed descriptors for root morphologies in chapter 1 and the superior attributes of the proposed mathematical diffusion process for shape description in chapter 2, the fixed-time step Monto Carlo simulations are applied in some $2D$ artifical images in this chapter to validate the research methodology and assumption.
